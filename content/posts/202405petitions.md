*Chadron, Nebraska – May 22, 2024* – The Dawes County Democratic Party is pleased to
announce that three important petitions will be available for signing every Friday night in June from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM at the Bean Broker in Chadron. Attendees are welcome to sign one,
two, or all three petitions.

Members of the Dawes County Democratic Party will be on hand to provide information and
facilitate the signing of the following petitions:

**1. Anti-LB1402 (Support Our Schools Nebraska):** This petition opposes Legislative Bill 1402, a proposed law that aims to reduce public school funding in Nebraska. LB1402 undermines the
quality of education by cutting essential resources, leading to larger class sizes and reduced
support for students and teachers.

**2. Medical Marijuana in Nebraska:** This petition supports the legalization of medical
marijuana in Nebraska. The initiative aims to provide patients with access to medical cannabis
for the treatment of chronic pain, epilepsy, and other serious medical conditions, under the
guidance of healthcare professionals.

**3. Protect Our Rights:** This petition advocates for protecting the right to choose and opposes recent legislative efforts to restrict access to abortion services in Nebraska. The petition seeks to ensure that individuals have the autonomy to make decisions about their own reproductive health.

Community members are encouraged to visit the Bean Broker on Friday evenings in June to
learn more about these important issues and to add their signatures in support of these causes.
