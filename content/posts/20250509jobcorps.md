What happens if we lose our local Job Corps? For Chadron, the answer is simple and devastating: economic damage, lost opportunity, and a community setback we can’t afford.

Right now, the Pine Ridge Job Corps program, located just south of Chadron Nebraska, faces elimination in the current federal budget. That’s not abstract—this directly threatens 33 full-time jobs right in the Chadron area, each with an average salary of $53,681. That’s 33 families buying groceries, paying mortgages, and supporting local businesses who may be forced to leave our community. That’s 33 homes at risk of going empty. That’s Chadron losing its lifeblood.

But it’s not just jobs. Our Pine Ridge Job Corps students—about 100 young people—contributed more than $1.15 million in direct community service last year alone. They provided nearly 15,000 hours of firefighting, 17,000+ hours of Forest Service support, and thousands more hours helping our rural community. These young people are helping fill the gaps left by shortfalls in maintenance and construction projects. Their 2025 schedule is already packed with local projects. If we lose them, who will pick up the slack?

The local Pine Ridge Job Corps center has an annual budget of $6 million. That’s money flowing directly into Chadron—through wages, supplies, fuel, housing, and equipment. Cut the program, and we lose all of it.

Here’s the return on investment: 97% of Job Corps graduates are employed when they finish—in firefighting, the military, manufacturing, and skilled trades—with an average starting salary that’s more than 2.5 times the federal minimum wage. We spend $105,264 over three years to educate one student. That graduate goes on to earn at least $1.6 million in their working lifetime.

Compare that to incarceration. It costs $38,000 a year to house someone in the Nebraska State Penitentiary. Multiply that by 40 years, and taxpayers spend $1.52 million on someone who contributes nothing in return to the community.

This isn’t just about saving a program—it’s about investing in people. Would you rather spend $105,000 to help someone become a taxpayer and community contributor—or 15 times that to lock them away?

We need our elected officials to stand up for Pine Ridge Job Corps **Call or email Senator Pete Ricketts, Senator Deb Fischer, and Congressman Adrian Smith today.** Tell them to protect the Job Corps and protect our local community.  This is about real people, real jobs, and our local future.
