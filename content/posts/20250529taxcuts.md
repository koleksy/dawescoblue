Senator Deb Fischer has been a strong supporter of extending the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), arguing that it benefits small businesses and strengthens Nebraska’s economy. With nearly 99% of Nebraska businesses classified as small and employing close to half the state’s workforce, Fischer says these tax cuts are essential for economic stability and growth.

But as debate intensifies around the new Big Beautiful Budget Bill, questions are emerging: Who really benefits from these policies?

The bill proposes $3.8 trillion in tax cuts. However, if temporary provisions—like tax breaks on tips and overtime pay—are made permanent, the total cost could exceed $5 trillion. At the same time, the bill opens the door for deep cuts to key programs like Medicaid and SNAP (food assistance), raising concerns about priorities and fairness.

Critics point out that the wealthiest Americans and large corporations stand to gain the most. According to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the bottom 10% of earners could see their household resources shrink by 4%, while the top 10% would receive a 2% boost—further widening the gap between rich and poor.

This raises an important question for Nebraska families and small businesses: Should they bear the long-term consequences of tax cuts that mainly benefit the ultra-wealthy?

As Senator Fischer continues to back these proposals, Nebraskans deserve a clear and honest accounting of how these policies affect them. Are we building a stronger economy for everyone—or just for a select few?

**Do these tax cuts reflect Nebraska’s values and best interests—or should we demand a fairer path forward?**
