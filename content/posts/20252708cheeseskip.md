**By** _Concerned Citizens of Western Nebraska_

Senator Deb Fischer recently made several stops in western Nebraska including a visit to Chadron on August 12th making appearances at NCAP Early Head Start and its affiliated centers. On the surface, it looked like a gesture of goodwill—a senator connecting with programs that serve Nebraska’s most vulnerable families. But her visit left behind a glaring question: *Why did she vote yes to a bill that guts the resources that Head Start families rely on?*

While the “One Big Beautiful Bill” doesn’t directly target Head Start funding, it guts the infrastructure that makes Head Start possible for thousands of Nebraska families. Here’s how:

- **Medicaid Cuts:** Nebraska stands to lose $6.5 billion in federal Medicaid funding over the next decade. That’s 30,000 fewer Nebraskans covered annually. Since 1 in 3 children under age 6 in Nebraska are on Medicaid, this threatens access to health care for Head Start kids.
- **SNAP Reductions:* The bill slashes $322 million from food assistance programs, affecting 64,000 children statewide. Hunger doesn’t just hurt—it hinders learning, growth, and development.
- **Ripple Effect on Services:** Rural hospitals and clinics are already struggling. Funding losses mean fewer local health screenings and developmental services—many of which are coordinated with Head Start.

Head Start isn’t just preschool. It’s a lifeline. It’s health screenings, nutrition, family support, and early education rolled into one. When programs like Medicaid and SNAP are gutted, Head Start staff are forced to fill the gaps—without additional resources.

So when Senator Fischer stops by these programs for a photo op, it rings hollow. Her votes undermine the very services she claims to support. If Deb Fischer truly believes in the value of Head Start and the families it serves, she should be willing to face those families. She should be willing to hear their concerns, answer their questions, and explain her votes.

Senator Fischer has not held a town hall meeting since 2017. It’s time for her to show up in communities across Nebraska; not just for show, not just for headlines, but for real dialogue.
